I felt like everyone was complaining about how everything has been owned by Dutch folks for decades.

Plus Bonaire has been a direct part of the Netherlands since 2010 so the Dutch couldn't have owned everything for decades. Even in 2016 the house prices were quite low. \n\nMost holiday homes are rented and used as passive money generators by mostly Dutch homeowners. Which will be a problem for them in the future because of a new policy coming up. Renting homes for holiday rentals will not be allowed in residential areas.\n\nI'm from Bonaire.

        "parent_comment": "Wait, really? Only in the last two years? This isn't what I was told at all, super interesting. I felt like everyone was complaining about how everything has been owned by Dutch folks for decades. But maybe people were just frustrated, and I take this stuff to heart because my family is also from a place where the holiday home people have bought up almost everything, called themselves local because they own property, and use the businesses as passive money generators, which screws the people who actually live there year round. I'm curious, are you originally from Bonaire? Or NL? I'm heading back for a month this winter and I'd love to learn more about this.",
        "comment": "Before Covid the rental and selling prices weren't as crazy as they are now. Plus Bonaire has been a direct part of the Netherlands since 2010 so the Dutch couldn't have owned everything for decades. Even in 2016 the house prices were quite low. \n\nMost holiday homes are rented and used as passive money generators by mostly Dutch homeowners. Which will be a problem for them in the future because of a new policy coming up. Renting homes for holiday rentals will not be allowed in residential areas.\n\nI'm from Bonaire. I've lived in NL for quite some time though. Hit me up when you're in Bonaire.",

        "parent_comment": "I don't know that they fit the fashionable side at all, but aerostich will make any pants, jackets or suits to your custom measurements and they come with the armor and abrasion features you're listing. They do men's and women's versions so the cuts will at least fit, though they won't look like jeans per se.",
        "comment": "Agreed. \n\nMy Aerostitch AD-1pants have been comfortable in all weather conditions\u2014wet, dry, sunny, windy, snowy, from 9\u00b0F to 123\u00b0F. I\u2019ve even hiked in them on cold motorcycle trips. \n\nFull-length leg zippers mean they go on/off over your street clothes in seconds, and full armor gives excellent crash protection (yes, I\u2019ve tested that as well). \n\nAs mentioned, they\u2019ll do custom sizes. And they\u2019ll do repairs if needed, even on really old stuff. Though you won\u2019t need repairs for anything other than a crash. \n\nThey\u2019re the only riding pants I\u2019ve needed in 20 years.",

They are now on their 3rd day of taking it but still they have watery stools. I tried to give them small amount of pumpkin this morning, hoping that will somehow solidify their stools.",

People were just thinking \"Well it's worth $20k but if I can get $40k for it I'll sell.\"\n\nI've been monitoring a couple of cars like this for a year now. It's worth looking at ~~when the ad was posted and~~ how often it's been changed. If it's been on for months then it's probably nonsense.\n\nOf course Carsales has no incentive to flush these off because more cars for sales equals better perception of it as a marketplace.",
