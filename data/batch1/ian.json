This time around, I\u2019m more conscious of lower body protection but struggling to find a pair of everyday protective moto pants that fit (mainly length issues) and are somewhat flattering. If I\u2019m spending $400+ on moto pants, I\u2019d rather not look like a kid swimming in my dads baggy gear. Prior to breaking my leg, I wore armored Kevlar jeans with knee/hip pads and leggings/rain pants layered as needed. In this setup, my legs felt much more exposed than the rest of my body in full gear. Some points to consider for recommendations:\n\n* I commute on my motorcycle daily, go on week-long moto camping tours, and ride in a lot of group events. I end up wearing my gear all day rather than stripping at every stop I make. Versatility and comfort are key.\n\n* Climate where I ride ranges from 40*F-90*F with a mix of rain and sunshine. I\u2019d prefer to buy 1 pair of all-weather overpants with removable insulation/rain liner.\n\n* My everyday wardrobe is either skinny jeans or scrubs so mesh under-armor wouldn\u2019t work for me. Hip and knee protection are a must. Shin protection would be nice but is not necessary. \n\n* Length is super important for me, as much female-oriented gear lands at mid-shin leaving the knee pads on my thighs. For whatever reason, moto gear manufacturers seem to think that adding 4\u201d of fabric to the end of pants is sufficient without re-proportioning the garment (hint: it\u2019s not). I\u2019m open to men\u2019s gear but again, it\u2019d be nice to wear something flattering since I ride daily.\n\n* I wear [this](https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/spidi-4season-evo-h2out-womens-jacket?gclid=Cj0KCQiAtbqdBhDvARIsAGYnXBPWnwbRojt1lxtuhZv5I_QpfzAZMe7Vaknamh9SdY1wwRh32WPbux0aAn7qEALw_wcB) jacket in size medium so it\u2019d be cool to find something somewhat matching but I\u2019m not too attached to that idea.\n\nEdit: formatting",

        "parent_comment": "I don't know that they fit the fashionable side at all, but aerostich will make any pants, jackets or suits to your custom measurements and they come with the armor and abrasion features you're listing. They do men's and women's versions so the cuts will at least fit, though they won't look like jeans per se.",
        "comment": "Agreed. \n\nMy Aerostitch AD-1pants have been comfortable in all weather conditions\u2014wet, dry, sunny, windy, snowy, from 9\u00b0F to 123\u00b0F. I\u2019ve even hiked in them on cold motorcycle trips. \n\nFull-length leg zippers mean they go on/off over your street clothes in seconds, and full armor gives excellent crash protection (yes, I\u2019ve tested that as well). \n\nAs mentioned, they\u2019ll do custom sizes. And they\u2019ll do repairs if needed, even on really old stuff. Though you won\u2019t need repairs for anything other than a crash. \n\nThey\u2019re the only riding pants I\u2019ve needed in 20 years.",

        "comment": "Thank you!!! I thought that I was the problem\u2026 I have to work on F360 everyday and it\u2019s literally never the case that it doesn\u2019t freeze up and crash every hour or so. First I tried to backtrack it in any way possible including lowest graphics settings. The most annoying thing is that it seems like there smth specific that triggers it (I persuaded myself into thinking it\u2019s when opening the PCB Design linked to the Schematic), but every other time it just freezes before I even get to open a project. And once it first crashed on a day, it crashes multiple times in the following hour ( at least until I restart the notebook) and then it\u2019s just a matter of hours until it starts all over again. And don\u2019t get me even started on the mess with all the recovery files that aren\u2019t linked anymore or you can\u2019t save anymore because you\u2019re not on the team (although single member project) anymore, tf?! I really started to regret making my m1 MacBook Pro my main because I thought it\u2019s some sort of compatibility issue cause it\u2019s a fairly new platform for this software. But I also had multiple crashes (although it seems not that often) on my Win10 with i7-7700k cpu 2080ti gpu 16gb ram and Samsung evo 500 ssd ( but it also could appear less crashing since I don\u2019t use it that often)\n\nI really, really find this unacceptable for a professional tool and it\u2019s also sad that it seems like Autodesk doesn\u2019t want to do much to help with that. I\u2019ve noticed that in the forums they are mostly trying to get out of their way when someone is asking when they are gonna add a feature they promised a year ago\u2026 and they\u2019re mostly gonna tell you: oh there\u2019s no deadline but I\u2019ll write it on my list and tell the devs.\nTbh I think that they are more interested in further improving their expensive softwares as revit or inventor and think that this is more than enough development and pace for a mostly free software as 360.\nAs I started using it years ago i really loved the new modern design, intuitive interface and how you could linke the pcb and simply make a 3d case for it in a splitsecond. I was even an advocate for the merge of eagle, but since then less and less attention has been paid and I think it\u2019s finally time for me to say goodbye and look for an alternative that suits my needs.\n\nSorry for the rant but it is just so depressing and it felt like the right time once I\u2019ve read your post ;)",

        "post": "My father is a veteran and is homeless (technically he lives in a trailer without electricity on an illegal cannabis farm). He has severe back issues and is scheduled to get back surgery at the VA but doesn't have a place to recover or any support. I'm assuming the VA deals with this stuff all the time. Does anybody have experience with this type of situation? Can they keep him until he is fully recovered?\n\nHe's kind of the traditional Vietnam PTSD veteran who wasn't able to integrate back into society. Unfortunately family support is not an option for a plethora of reasons.\n\nEdit: I'm on hold with the homeless veterans program. I would still appreciate any information about options available.",
