        "comment": "I was feeling the same way going into my second cycle. I was devastated after I wasn\u2019t pregnant the first and couldn\u2019t be anything but negative.\n\nSecond cycle was full of negativity for me and I stopped symptom spotting. My husband was tired of me being negative and said \u201ctake a test already!\u201d\n\nIt immediately became positive and I sobbed like a baby couldn\u2019t believe it!! That was cycle 2!! And I believe it worked out this way for a reason \n\nFirst cycle my follicle was 19mm,we had people visiting, and it was just difficult because everything felt rushed.\n\nSecond cycle we had relations couple nights before the shot and then as they instructed and the boom 12DPO I got my positive and follicle was 22mm \ud83d\ude03\n\nNot sure if follicle size matters but it made me feel more positive \n\nTips: have sex a couple days before. Sperm can live up to 5 days in the uterus so you want it there waiting when the egg comes down. I laid down for 15 minutes after each time, with my legs up for 2 instead of peeing right after. And when my husband was \u201cfinishing up\u201d I did not let him move and held him in place lol. Some doctors say it doesn\u2019t matter but may have helped \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nGood luck \ud83d\udc9e",

This time around, I\u2019m more conscious of lower body protection but struggling to find a pair of everyday protective moto pants that fit (mainly length issues) and are somewhat flattering. If I\u2019m spending $400+ on moto pants, I\u2019d rather not look like a kid swimming in my dads baggy gear. Prior to breaking my leg, I wore armored Kevlar jeans with knee/hip pads and leggings/rain pants layered as needed. In this setup, my legs felt much more exposed than the rest of my body in full gear. Some points to consider for recommendations:\n\n* I commute on my motorcycle daily, go on week-long moto camping tours, and ride in a lot of group events. I end up wearing my gear all day rather than stripping at every stop I make. Versatility and comfort are key.\n\n* Climate where I ride ranges from 40*F-90*F with a mix of rain and sunshine. I\u2019d prefer to buy 1 pair of all-weather overpants with removable insulation/rain liner.\n\n* My everyday wardrobe is either skinny jeans or scrubs so mesh under-armor wouldn\u2019t work for me. Hip and knee protection are a must. Shin protection would be nice but is not necessary. \n\n* Length is super important for me, as much female-oriented gear lands at mid-shin leaving the knee pads on my thighs. For whatever reason, moto gear manufacturers seem to think that adding 4\u201d of fabric to the end of pants is sufficient without re-proportioning the garment (hint: it\u2019s not).

        "parent_comment": "I don't know that they fit the fashionable side at all, but aerostich will make any pants, jackets or suits to your custom measurements and they come with the armor and abrasion features you're listing. They do men's and women's versions so the cuts will at least fit, though they won't look like jeans per se.",
        "comment": "Agreed. \n\nMy Aerostitch AD-1pants have been comfortable in all weather conditions\u2014wet, dry, sunny, windy, snowy, from 9\u00b0F to 123\u00b0F. I\u2019ve even hiked in them on cold motorcycle trips. \n\nFull-length leg zippers mean they go on/off over your street clothes in seconds, and full armor gives excellent crash protection (yes, I\u2019ve tested that as well). \n\nAs mentioned, they\u2019ll do custom sizes. And they\u2019ll do repairs if needed, even on really old stuff. Though you won\u2019t need repairs for anything other than a crash. \n\nThey\u2019re the only riding pants I\u2019ve needed in 20 years.",

Prior to breaking my leg, I wore armored Kevlar jeans with knee/hip pads and leggings/rain pants layered as needed. In this setup, my legs felt much more exposed than the rest of my body in full gear. Some points to consider for recommendations:\n\n* I commute on my motorcycle daily, go on week-long moto camping tours, and ride in a lot of group events. I end up wearing my gear all day rather than stripping at every stop I make. Versatility and comfort are key.\n\n* Climate where I ride ranges from 40*F-90*F with a mix of rain and sunshine. I\u2019d prefer to buy 1 pair of all-weather overpants with removable insulation/rain liner.\n\n* My everyday wardrobe is either skinny jeans or scrubs so mesh under-armor wouldn\u2019t work for me. Hip and knee protection are a must. Shin protection would be nice but is not necessary. \n\n* Length is super important for me, as much female-oriented gear lands at mid-shin leaving the knee pads on my thighs. For whatever reason, moto gear manufacturers seem to think that adding 4\u201d of fabric to the end of pants is sufficient without re-proportioning the garment (hint: it\u2019s not). I\u2019m open to men\u2019s gear but again, it\u2019d be nice to wear something flattering since I ride daily.\n\n* I wear [this](https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/spidi-4season-evo-h2out-womens-jacket?gclid=Cj0KCQiAtbqdBhDvARIsAGYnXBPWnwbRojt1lxtuhZv5I_QpfzAZMe7Vaknamh9SdY1wwRh32WPbux0aAn7qEALw_wcB) jacket in size medium so it\u2019d be cool to find something somewhat matching but I\u2019m not too attached to that idea.\n\nEdit: formatting",

        "post": "Thank you so much for creating this group. I am so in over my head.  \n\nLast month I was diagnosed with t2d. I am in my early 30s and am 5\u20195\u201d at 150lbs. My glucose was 446 and my A1c was 13.8%. I didn\u2019t feel sick or anything - felt totally normal. The reason I went to the doctor - the dermatologist actually! - was for insane hair loss. \n\nMy brand new endocrinologist put me on 2000mg of Metformin a day. My glucose is still averaging around 260 a couple weeks later. So she JUST prescribed me mounjaro at 2.5 for one month, to go up to 5 after that. \n\nI am so new to diabetes and so new to medications. Any helpful tips or advice is so welcome here. About diet, meds, monitoring.. anything! I am swimming in information \ud83e\udd75\n\nTHANK YOU!!",

We went out the Ninth Avenue exit of the Port Authority Building and walked to 42nd Street. A M42 MTA bus stopped at the corner to let passengers off and on and was rear ended by a box truck. Passengers in the bus were thrown all over. \n\nMy friend immediately got into the open exit door of the bus, waved for me to join him, and then he dropped to the floor. I didn\u2019t join him on the bus, but watched as police, fire and ambulances arrived. He and a half dozen other people were transported to St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital.
