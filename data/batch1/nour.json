I was devastated after I wasn\u2019t pregnant the first and couldn\u2019t be anything but negative.\n\nSecond cycle was full of negativity for me and I stopped symptom spotting. My husband was tired of me being negative and said \u201ctake a test already!\u201d\n\nIt immediately became positive and I sobbed like a baby couldn\u2019t believe it!! That was cycle 2!! And I believe it worked out this way for a reason \n\nFirst cycle my follicle was 19mm,we had people visiting, and it was just difficult because everything felt rushed.\n\nSecond cycle we had relations couple nights before the shot and then as they instructed and the boom 12DPO I got my positive and follicle was 22mm \ud83d\ude03\n\nNot sure if follicle size matters but it made me feel more positive \n\nTips: have sex a couple days before. Sperm can live up to 5 days in the uterus so you want it there waiting when the egg comes down. I laid down for 15 minutes after each time, with my legs up for 2 instead of peeing right after. And when my husband was \u201cfinishing up\u201d I did not let him move and held him in place lol. Some doctors say it doesn\u2019t matter but may have helped \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nGood luck \ud83d\udc9e",

        "post": "Thank you so much for creating this group. I am so in over my head.  \n\nLast month I was diagnosed with t2d. I am in my early 30s and am 5\u20195\u201d at 150lbs. My glucose was 446 and my A1c was 13.8%. I didn\u2019t feel sick or anything - felt totally normal. The reason I went to the doctor - the dermatologist actually! - was for insane hair loss. \n\nMy brand new endocrinologist put me on 2000mg of Metformin a day. My glucose is still averaging around 260 a couple weeks later. So she JUST prescribed me mounjaro at 2.5 for one month, to go up to 5 after that. \n\nI am so new to diabetes and so new to medications. Any helpful tips or advice is so welcome here. About diet, meds, monitoring.. anything! I am swimming in information \ud83e\udd75\n\nTHANK YOU!!",

I personally don't mind hearing them walking around and I imagine we will get used to it pretty quickly.",

I thought that I was the problem\u2026 I have to work on F360 everyday and it\u2019s literally never the case that it doesn\u2019t freeze up and crash every hour or so. First I tried to backtrack it in any way possible including lowest graphics settings. The most annoying thing is that it seems like there smth specific that triggers it (I persuaded myself into thinking it\u2019s when opening the PCB Design linked to the Schematic), but every other time it just freezes before I even get to open a project. And once it first crashed on a day, it crashes multiple times in the following hour ( at least until I restart the notebook) and then it\u2019s just a matter of hours until it starts all over again. And don\u2019t get me even started on the mess with all the recovery files that aren\u2019t linked anymore or you can\u2019t save anymore because you\u2019re not on the team (although single member project) anymore, tf?! I really started to regret making my m1 MacBook Pro my main because I thought it\u2019s some sort of compatibility issue cause it\u2019s a fairly new platform for this software. But I also had multiple crashes (although it seems not that often) on my Win10 with i7-7700k cpu 2080ti gpu 16gb ram and Samsung evo 500 ssd ( but it also could appear less crashing since I don\u2019t use it that often)\n\nI really, really find this unacceptable for a professional tool and it\u2019s also sad that it seems like Autodesk doesn\u2019t want to do much to help with that. I\u2019ve noticed that in the forums they are mostly trying to get out of their way when someone is asking when they are gonna add a feature they promised a year ago\u2026 and they\u2019re mostly gonna tell you: oh there\u2019s no deadline but I\u2019ll write it on my list and tell the devs.\nTbh I think that they are more interested in further improving their expensive softwares as revit or inventor and think that this is more than enough development and pace for a mostly free software as 360.\nAs I started using it years ago i really loved the new modern design, intuitive interface and how you could linke the pcb and simply make a 3d case for it in a splitsecond. I was even an advocate for the merge of eagle, but since then less and less attention has been paid and I think it\u2019s finally time for me to say goodbye and look for an alternative that suits my needs.\n\nSorry for the rant but it is just so depressing and it felt like the right time once I\u2019ve read your post ;)",
