This whole pathetic argument is how I managed to score a whopping non-foreplay 2minutes of duty sex. \n\nThe following day, we showered together. I tried to initiate by rubbing up against him and touching him.  He just jumped out of the shower to dry off. We used to shower and have sex every day! It\u2019s bad enough that he NEVER innitates until I beg anymore. Then it\u2019ll happen once and go back to the usual. \n\n Today I mentioned how it\u2019s too early to be wearing pants as he was throwing on jeans. I was sprawled out naked on the bed and trying to be a tease. He came up with every excuse under the sun. He said he has work at 4pm\u2026 It was 8am\u2026 He works 20 minutes away.

What I can do better? How to be a better wife so maybe he\u2019ll want me like he used to\u2026.\n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder if he\u2019s cheating on me\u2026 If I knew marriage with no kids meant no sex, I would\u2019ve never signed up!

But even I fall into the trap of using books (99% romance novels lol) as a \u201cbuffer\u201d from my life, tough things I don\u2019t want to think about and just to pass time when I don\u2019t want to deal with things. \n\nIt\u2019s good to notice that and try to be more mindful with reading. People do it ALL the time with stuff (buffering)\u2026 Netflix, exercise, food, alcohol, social media, work\u2026 to distract from thoughts, feelings, things we don\u2019t want to do. \n\nI always find myself getting into a book easier when I really need to clean lol",
        "comment": "I am aware that I do use reading as a buffer. I can track back to the times where I've been reading more than other times. And it's usually during the times where I'm trying to escape something (this last period of reading frenzy was triggered by the pandemic and the world being on fire) that I read more. It's probably why I am wondering about it now. If it's 'just' that, or that I'm stuck in fiction fantasy. \n\n[Edit] And as an afterthought, if it's a bad thing to be stuck in fiction fantasy? Because it makes me happy reading romance and live in those worlds for a while. Though that sometimes feels like an addiction, you know. I don't want to problemize this feeling, I am conscious of what I'm doing. And I love reading romance novels! It's just, I don't know anybody around me who reads romance so that's why I'm asking here.",

My Top Spotify Artists of 2022 were Charli XCX, Taylor Swift, Carly Rae Jepsen, Snow Strippers, and Danny L Harle. \n\nI also enjoy becoming friends with the people I live with, but if we just keep to ourselves and create a comfortable living space that\u2019s fine, too!

        "comment": "I am so sorry you are going through this. I was with my husband for 13 years when he decided to leave me just over 2 months ago now. I went through the same thing (and still kinda do). Not sleeping well (he also still cohabitates since we have kids, and he\u2019s still in the bed, very awk), not eating well, not exercising the way I used to, not caring to make plans or do anything.  Some days are ok, some days are just terrible. Music triggers me. Tv/movies trigger me. It\u2019s going to be very bad before getting better. And then loneliness is going to set in, and I fear that will be the worst stage for us. Honestly, I don\u2019t think it gets better, you will learn how to cope and what helps to push those sad, angry, frustrated feelings aside. You will get stronger mentally and emotionally. It\u2019s day by day. Individual to individual. It\u2019s hard. And it hurts. I\u2019m starting to care less and less as the days go on. Some days I still sit and think how he can just leave his family behind, but at this point, i won\u2019t change his mind and I\u2019ve already apologized for everything on my end and, shamefully, begged him back with no success. I have to keep trooping on. And so do u. Take baby steps.",

The biggest game changers for me are learning properly about pacing and self compassion when it comes to movement and pain. Also, I imagine you are exhausted-your job is so full on. Doing yoga or other strengthening things is actually really excellent because it will help you have a strong foundation without completely wearing you out.

An escrow adjustment was made at the end of November, I received a notification from Geico that my Premium increased from 1440 to about 2850!!! (Shitty ass HomeSite Company Geico affiliates with).  I found that the increase was **not** due to property tax - just the insurance company overpricing.\n\nSo I left Geico for State Farm first week of Dec.  My new insurance and paperwork was accepted by my Bank on 12/8.  I called the bank **each and every week** asking for the escrow to again be adjusted as I have a 60 day grace period where no late fees would be applied so I wanted to see if I could get my mortgage payment readjusted before I started paying again.\n\nFast forward to 12/29 and this was still not completed.  So my question is what can I do about this besides tracking the extra money I am paying based on my old insurance and hoping for a refund once they actually do the job I asked them to do back in early December?  I am just wondering if I missed something here in terms of pushing for the escrow as I did request this multiple times.  Unfortunately I paid my Nov and Dec Mortgage, but I am keeping all the information hoping I get refunded back the extra money I am paying.\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated ... Thank you.  I feel I was screwed pretty good here.",

        "comment": "PTSD causes me to shut down in stressful events. I'm not a doctor by any means, but I think that you're shutting down because your brain is trying to keep yourself alive in what it sees as a threatening situation. It shuts down your fight or flight and essentially stops \"recording\" so that you can focus on your survival. I view my trauma like I'm watching a movie because my brain fully disconnected me from the experiences. Triggers cause my brain to return to that moment, attached with the emotions I should have felt then. Having flashbacks of traumatic events months after the event is usually how people discover that they have PTSD, because suddenly that apathetic disconnect becomes overwhelmingly personal. I wish you the best and it can be helpful to learn PTSD coping skills for any kind of trauma whether it causes PTSD or not. Good luck and stay safe.",
