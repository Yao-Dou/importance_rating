You don't want to downgrade your knowledge to become CRA, as a clinical scientist you work with study physician and perform medical monitoring, evaluating medical data etc. You will write protocols or amendments, answer regulatory questio , site questions etc. For this job you need to have clinical knowledge and clinical experience. It took me about 1 year to get this job, and I was a study coordinator and later team lead at the site level. But you will need to work on some skills, like protocol writing etc. Try to find PIs who are doing pi initiated studies. I volunteered a lot to get experience and publications",

So yes, if the doctor wants they can read and see anything and everything from your VA visits, as well as outside medical records. I don't know your childhood trauma, what your rating is, or even what you went through in the military. However, I would be cautious as to what you say regarding childhood trauma because yes, they can use it to reduce you. Also, it may help you if its your first claim for mental health.

My A1c test this month was a 6.4 (down from a 6.5 last month) and overall my sugar readings haven\u2019t been too bad.\n\nTwo days ago I started feeling really crappy and checked my sugar to find it 250. It didn\u2019t go down throughout the night or the next morning. Called my Dr. and she had me come in to do labs to make sure everything was fine which it was. \n\nIt finally starting dropping around 4pm but it only got into the 160s before it spiked to the 200s again after eating dinner (this dinner maybe had 9 carbs max). \n\nI woke up with it at 215 again today and still feel gross. \n\nAny ideas what might be causing the spikes? I haven\u2019t been eating a bunch of sugar/carbs and I didn\u2019t take a break in my exercise so I\u2019m a little lost!",
        "parent_comment": "you get monthly a1c results? also, sounds like  you had an infection that you didn't notice in a usual way(fever, cough etc) and body was reacting etc... or did you eat something new? hope all is well otherwise",
        "comment": "Since being off my medication my dr. asked me to do an a1c test monthly at home to make sure i\u2019m staying stable for the first few months. i\u2019m wondering if my period has anything to do with it? i did just end that but i haven\u2019t been sick so maybe i\u2019m fighting something off",

        "post": "Hi all;\n\nHoping you can help a new home-owner with a situation.\n\nMy loan was transferred to a New Bank and when that happened ... An escrow adjustment was made at the end of November, I received a notification from Geico that my Premium increased from 1440 to about 2850!!! (Shitty ass HomeSite Company Geico affiliates with).  I found that the increase was **not** due to property tax - just the insurance company overpricing.\n\nSo I left Geico for State Farm first week of Dec.  My new insurance and paperwork was accepted by my Bank on 12/8.  I called the bank **each and every week** asking for the escrow to again be adjusted as I have a 60 day grace period where no late fees would be applied so I wanted to see if I could get my mortgage payment readjusted before I started paying again.\n\nFast forward to 12/29 and this was still not completed.  So my question is what can I do about this besides tracking the extra money I am paying based on my old insurance and hoping for a refund once they actually do the job I asked them to do back in early December?  I am just wondering if I missed something here in terms of pushing for the escrow as I did request this multiple times.  Unfortunately I paid my Nov and Dec Mortgage, but I am keeping all the information hoping I get refunded back the extra money I am paying.\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated ... Thank you.

My new insurance and paperwork was accepted by my Bank on 12/8.  I called the bank **each and every week** asking for the escrow to again be adjusted as I have a 60 day grace period where no late fees would be applied so I wanted to see if I could get my mortgage payment readjusted before I started paying again.\n\nFast forward to 12/29 and this was still not completed.  So my question is what can I do about this besides tracking the extra money I am paying based on my old insurance and hoping for a refund once they actually do the job I asked them to do back in early December?  I am just wondering if I missed something here in terms of pushing for the escrow as I did request this multiple times.  Unfortunately I paid my Nov and Dec Mortgage, but I am keeping all the information hoping I get refunded back the extra money I am paying.\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated ... Thank you.  I feel I was screwed pretty good here.",

Just to be clear don't ever be mean or in anyway tell a female anything negative. Every woman is beautiful and should be appreciated. \n\nAt the same time you don't have to cum for them.. and if that makes them want to fuck you more then what's the problem?? \n\nIf you fuck her again and deside to give her your seed, make sure you get her to lick it off her tits so you can say \"damn girl,  I love that you tits are the same size! Why bitches tits always be lop sided? Good thing yours aren't all crooked and shit.. I bet your friend hate going beach with you\".  \n\nHaha fuck you crooked sluts mad I won't cum on you!",
