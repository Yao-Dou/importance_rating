I talk a little dirty to get the mood going, I send sexy photos to him, flash him randomly, walk around topless, wear lingerie around the house, etc. But lately it feels IMPOSSIBLE. \n\nI DID manage to get laid for 2 minutes the other day. It was the first 2 minutes since the last 2 minutes in October. He was drunk in October so I don\u2019t even want to count it. We didn\u2019t even have sex on our wedding anniversary last week!\n\nHow did I win these 2 minutes? By ONCE AGAIN telling him that I feel unattractive and unwanted to him. By telling him I crave touch and that closeness. That it\u2019s not just sex to me. It\u2019s that special connection that I get to have with one person out of over 7million on the planet. This whole pathetic argument is how I managed to score a whopping non-foreplay 2minutes of duty sex. \n\nThe following day, we showered together. I tried to initiate by rubbing up against him and touching him.  He just jumped out of the shower to dry off. We used to shower and have sex every day! It\u2019s bad enough that he NEVER innitates until I beg anymore. Then it\u2019ll happen once and go back to the usual. \n\n Today I mentioned how it\u2019s too early to be wearing pants as he was throwing on jeans. I was sprawled out naked on the bed and trying to be a tease. He came up with every excuse under the sun. He said he has work at 4pm\u2026 It was 8am\u2026 He works 20 minutes away. SMH \n\nI\u2019m tired of having to beg. And I tell myself I won\u2019t say anything about it anymore but then it just builds up to the point I want to scream so I collect my thoughts and once again, calmly ask why without blame. What I can do better? How to be a better wife so maybe he\u2019ll want me like he used to\u2026.\n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder if he\u2019s cheating on me\u2026 If I knew marriage with no kids meant no sex, I would\u2019ve never signed up! We are both 31 and used to be like rabbits. :(\n\nHe refuses to see a doctor and won\u2019t tell me why so I\u2019m left to assume. This SUCKS",

You don't want to downgrade your knowledge to become CRA, as a clinical scientist you work with study physician and perform medical monitoring, evaluating medical data etc. You will write protocols or amendments, answer regulatory questio , site questions etc. For this job you need to have clinical knowledge and clinical experience. It took me about 1 year to get this job, and I was a study coordinator and later team lead at the site level. But you will need to work on some skills, like protocol writing etc. Try to find PIs who are doing pi initiated studies. I volunteered a lot to get experience and publications",

Of course I know that, I'm no fool. \n\nBut then I think to myself: wait, I do spend a lot of time feeling like I'm in love with a book, the love story, the main character(s), the author's writing, the feel of a story, the sex in a story, the romance a.o.. I think about it in between or after the reading, in other words: I think about it a lot. That must have some impact on my real life, right? But I don't know how to distinguish if or how that is true. \n\nDo do you experience this? Is reading romance getting 'in the way' of your real romantic life?",
        "parent_comment": "I doubt romance novels are seeping into your reality (only you know you and can answer that). But even I fall into the trap of using books (99% romance novels lol) as a \u201cbuffer\u201d from my life, tough things I don\u2019t want to think about and just to pass time when I don\u2019t want to deal with things. \n\nIt\u2019s good to notice that and try to be more mindful with reading. People do it ALL the time with stuff (buffering)\u2026 Netflix, exercise, food, alcohol, social media, work\u2026 to distract from thoughts, feelings, things we don\u2019t want to do. \n\nI always find myself getting into a book easier when I really need to clean lol",
        "comment": "I am aware that I do use reading as a buffer. I can track back to the times where I've been reading more than other times. And it's usually during the times where I'm trying to escape something (this last period of reading frenzy was triggered by the pandemic and the world being on fire) that I read more. It's probably why I am wondering about it now. If it's 'just' that, or that I'm stuck in fiction fantasy. \n\n[Edit] And as an afterthought, if it's a bad thing to be stuck in fiction fantasy? Because it makes me happy reading romance and live in those worlds for a while. Though that sometimes feels like an addiction, you know. I don't want to problemize this feeling, I am conscious of what I'm doing. And I love reading romance novels! It's just, I don't know anybody around me who reads romance so that's why I'm asking here.",

I don't know your childhood trauma, what your rating is, or even what you went through in the military. However, I would be cautious as to what you say regarding childhood trauma because yes, they can use it to reduce you. Also, it may help you if its your first claim for mental health.

        "comment": "I am so sorry you are going through this. I was with my husband for 13 years when he decided to leave me just over 2 months ago now. I went through the same thing (and still kinda do). Not sleeping well (he also still cohabitates since we have kids, and he\u2019s still in the bed, very awk), not eating well, not exercising the way I used to, not caring to make plans or do anything.  Some days are ok, some days are just terrible. Music triggers me. Tv/movies trigger me. It\u2019s going to be very bad before getting better. And then loneliness is going to set in, and I fear that will be the worst stage for us. Honestly, I don\u2019t think it gets better, you will learn how to cope and what helps to push those sad, angry, frustrated feelings aside. You will get stronger mentally and emotionally. It\u2019s day by day. Individual to individual. It\u2019s hard. And it hurts. I\u2019m starting to care less and less as the days go on. Some days I still sit and think how he can just leave his family behind, but at this point, i won\u2019t change his mind and I\u2019ve already apologized for everything on my end and, shamefully, begged him back with no success. I have to keep trooping on. And so do u. Take baby steps.",

Take this time to get reacquainted with yourself. Figure out who you are and what you really want. Allow yourself to grieve the end of the relationship. It will be a rollercoaster of emotions, but you have to tough it out. Don\u2019t try to avoid it. Talk to other friends or family that have experienced a divorce. Whatever you do, do not give in to anger, fear and resentment after the dust settles. It\u2019s an easy path of self destruction. Know your worth and rise above. It does get better and it does get easier, but you do have to put in the work. You got this it. I wish you the best on your new journey.",

        "post": "I found this thread because I heard \"boyfriend dick\" on a podcast and remembered my autistic girlfriend trying to explain the concept...\n\nEvery guy reading this should learn to be happy with whatever they have and treat every partner and experience as something unique that they can learn from and apply it the next time... I learned this early on because I did questionable shit with questionable people, wayy wayy too early. The group of girls I hung out with would all talk shit and tell me I was small but I was having sex with all of them... Sometimes all of them together so who gives a fuck what shit they talk? \n\nAlso lesbians don't got dicks and somehow lesbian couples are just fine being together so don't worry about your dick size because you performance will be lacking if you aren't confident.. pretend you are a lesbian and don't even use your dick. Don't use your dick until she begs for it and if you like having sex with her don't let her make you cum.\n\nIf you feel like your going to cum just switch what your doing and eat it first because girls like that shit :) calm your ass down and tire her out...   When it's apparent your not going to cum for her she will say something... They always did. It's either going to be encouraging or a WTF?! But tell her it's all good and you enjoy fucking her and making her cum turns you on. - If you meet a 10/10 but it's a spur of the moment whirlwind crazy type hookup, she is not someone you really know but it's like a party and if it goes wrong she will tell everyone how tiny your dick then now you got a plan! \n\nThis works because if you don't cum she will internalize whatever insecurity she has about herself and project that it bothers you and is unattractive and that's why you can't cum.....  It's literally the exact same situation  as having a super tiny dick and becoming so worried about your penis that you don't enjoy the sex. Also remember that just fucking a bitch and cumming in her or on her or whatever is the same whatever kind of dick you got... Probably same as lesbian dick but idk. \n\nI guess this leads me full circle..  \n\nMy current girlfriend made me cum extremely fast the first time we had sex and I think she does something with her mind or soul vibration that I can't defend against. she is so smart and intimidating that I can't get hard sometimes and it is weird not having the same control I had over my dick when I was younger. I have realized that it's my body letting me know that she is the one I want to make a family with and that's what's going on with that. She cornered me about my past and decided to look into the girls I have been with and that made her feel shitty because she compared herself to other people. I asked her about my dick size and she said lots of the same stuff that OPs gf said.. pretty much all of it. \n\nIm pretty sure my girlfriend has some minor autistic traits because she does this type of thing all the time.. she doesn't quite understand how what she says can make people feel but at the same time she is honest. So I made her  describe every one of her previous partners dicks and what was wrong that she didn't stay around. I learned that being thick is better than long and if you can reach the cervix you should every now and again bust her guts up on purpose and make it hurt when you fuck her because that's vacation dick energy and boyfriend dicks are perfect for at home or away",

Just to be clear don't ever be mean or in anyway tell a female anything negative. Every woman is beautiful and should be appreciated. \n\nAt the same time you don't have to cum for them.. and if that makes them want to fuck you more then what's the problem?? \n\nIf you fuck her again and deside to give her your seed, make sure you get her to lick it off her tits so you can say \"damn girl,  I love that you tits are the same size! Why bitches tits always be lop sided? Good thing yours aren't all crooked and shit.. I bet your friend hate going beach with you\".  \n\nHaha fuck you crooked sluts mad I won't cum on you!",
