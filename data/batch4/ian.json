Been on 150xl then 300xl then back to 150xl, 100sr 2x per day and back to the same 300xl that i'm holding since a month now.\n\nIts my first time tolerating 300xl and the good effects are being felt. Still a anxious wreck tho.\n\nI don't know if its part of the anxiety but I really somehow feel like there a pressure on the back of my head. I don't think its a tight muscle thing, it really feel like if my brain is \"overheating\" or \"making new connection\"\n\nI can't say it makes me feel bad, just weird? I looked around and it seems like i'm the only one in the world feeling it. Not really alot of side effect now a month after jumping on 300xl again, but this... and physical anxiety sometimes.\n\nThe pressure is felt from \"inside  the skull, it probably does make sense at all, but thats the best way the describe it. Kinda like brain zap from ssri, but in a enjoyable more constant feeling.\n\nAnyone else?",

So yes, if the doctor wants they can read and see anything and everything from your VA visits, as well as outside medical records. I don't know your childhood trauma, what your rating is, or even what you went through in the military. However, I would be cautious as to what you say regarding childhood trauma because yes, they can use it to reduce you. Also, it may help you if its your first claim for mental health.

Other than the Ritz, the Westin is the only lower cost hotel I\u2019d consider staying at again. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t stay at any of the others again. Terrible, terrible experiences with other hotel guests. The Ritz Carlton is a safe bet that guests that behave poorly won\u2019t be staying there. \n\nThe biggest issue I had at the other downtown hotels were people drunkenly roaming the halls at night screaming obscenities, and hotel security not having the staff to do absolutely anything about it.",

I'm not a doctor by any means, but I think that you're shutting down because your brain is trying to keep yourself alive in what it sees as a threatening situation. It shuts down your fight or flight and essentially stops \"recording\" so that you can focus on your survival. I view my trauma like I'm watching a movie because my brain fully disconnected me from the experiences. Triggers cause my brain to return to that moment, attached with the emotions I should have felt then. Having flashbacks of traumatic events months after the event is usually how people discover that they have PTSD, because suddenly that apathetic disconnect becomes overwhelmingly personal. I wish you the best and it can be helpful to learn PTSD coping skills for any kind of trauma whether it causes PTSD or not. Good luck and stay safe.",

        "comment": "The podcast was something on bitchute about Andrew Tate getting arrested and then a woman said something about boyfriend dick I honestly don't know.\n\nFuxk you for mocking my psychological and mental disability and judging my moral character while I try to share 30 years of my life in the hopes that one of you tiny dick incels might find a good woman. \n\nAnyway, I hope the information can be helpful in some way. Just to be clear don't ever be mean or in anyway tell a female anything negative. Every woman is beautiful and should be appreciated. \n\nAt the same time you don't have to cum for them.. and if that makes them want to fuck you more then what's the problem?? \n\nIf you fuck her again and deside to give her your seed, make sure you get her to lick it off her tits so you can say \"damn girl,  I love that you tits are the same size! Why bitches tits always be lop sided? Good thing yours aren't all crooked and shit.. I bet your friend hate going beach with you\".  \n\nHaha fuck you crooked sluts mad I won't cum on you!",
