I'm quite ashamed to say that I'm living based on the graces of my family that has been helping and understanding so far. And to be honest, even if disability is approved it's still something I struggle with. I feel really... undeserving and it haunts me to know that I'll be receiving money due to my own inability rather than abilities/work.\n\nI've been in therapy and have tried and am continuing to try different medications. I have yet to make any progress in improvements despite this. We recently learned that my body does not metabolize SSRI medication effectively through a blood test, pharmacogenetics. It was awful hearing that news, knowing that many people with depression and anxiety have been helped by those medications. And knowing that the large majority of antidepressants and anxiety management drugs are SSRI's.\n\nI've had a lot of insight and growth in understanding my emotions thanks to therapy and have tried and are trying exposure therapy but have yet any real progression in terms of how I feel and how far/long I can go outside for. I seem to have a quite severe agoraphobia... Typically I have to take at least 2mg of Xanax to get myself manageable to go outside.

        "comment": "Not a long-winded response at all :) It is an interesting subject, I haven't considered dating anyone in the past few years for other health reasons (which have ironically led to my agoraphobia) so I am also curious if people would date me in the future haha. There is a lot of nuance and it is more complex than people initially realise to navigate the dating world whilst also dealing with health conditions, whether physical or mental. But those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind. \n\nYou have possibly had more progress than you realise but it is always difficult to see when it is small, slowly but surely. The fact that you recognise you have agoraphobia, have safe spaces, know your limits, go to therapy and are making an effort is all a lot of progress that you should be very proud of! \n\nIt is a shame that you are unable to take SSRI medications. It does sound like you have a deep insight into yourself and therapy is proving a positive influence in your life.\n\nDisability income is not undeserved if it is needed to survive and support yourself in being independent. I am unable to walk very far, does this make me undeserving of support? No. I use a walking stick to support me. It is the same principle for disability income, whether it is needed for physical or mental health conditions.",

        "post": "I am 29 weeks pregnant and ended up in the ER with hyephema and bleeding eye after my 2 year old banged a toy in my eye. The pain was pretty bad and I was throughtly checked. While no serious damage besides a corneal cut and lots of pain, they gave me an eye drop which they said is safe. It was an NSAID. However I am reading online that these drops are category C and that there are adverse impacts in animal studies. I was reassured by the doctor in the ER they won't cause harm but I'm panicking not to mention not taking my next dose and deciding to just bear the eye pain. Has anyone had to take category C medicines or eye drops for pain? My maternity clinic is closed this week.  Thank you and sorry for the rant.",

The unfortunate part of life is that we tend to find partners who are like of our parent, all because they and their personality are \"familiar\".\n\n\nIn the most simple answer: *someone who isn't like your parent*.\n\n\nMy father-in-law was not a great father/husband, even my own father was not a great husband (lots of resentment spanning decades), but I digress.\n\n\nI propose a single exercise for this weekend:\nAsk yourself, if a friend/acquaintance/stranger, did or said [this] to me, would I be ok with it and want to be their friend?\n\n\nWe shouldn't accept any behavior from our partner that we wouldn't except from a friend. \n\n\nOne of the purposes of dating is to decide / discover what we like and what we're willing to accept.\n\n\nTake the next few days, look back at your previous relationships, and decide what you didn't like and why they didn't work.",

I can just do these habits and things will gradually get better, and I'll find antidepressants that work better and better and things will be okay\" and then sometimes \"Life is meaningless. There is no hope. None at all.\" \n\nThe thing that's helped me is to realize that neither of those thoughts can really be trusted. I shouldn't necessarily trust my overly optimistic self, but I shouldn't trust my completely depressed self either. The reality is that neither knows the future, and that although many people go through 20 antidepressants with no luck, there is always the chance that something could shift for me, either by antidepressants or some other means, that makes things livable. Do your own research and find a mental health professional who will actually take time to understand your situation and won't only prescribe SSRIs and SNRIs. This is key. \n\nAnd try to find and list things that can help in any way while you try to . Journal every day and get out of your head. Things like going for a walk, reading, etc. aren't cures for depression and are hard to do when you're depressed, but maybe there is that 20% of the time they can help. And so you can like clockwork try these things that might help. Some days none of them do. So then you just live for another day when they might.",

Last Option:  Move a Stock with great potential that will recover but currently has a tax loss associated if I sell it?    Would appreciated your thoughts on this matter.",

They have [192.168.4.xxx](https://192.168.4.xxx/) static ip addresses.\n\nThe router and buisness computers are on vlan01, the native vlan with the ip address of the router at [192.168.2.1](https://192.168.2.1/), and the other computers either through DHCP or static ip addresses.\n\nI think that I want to move the router, switches and ap to [192.168.1.0](https://192.168.2.0/)/24 and make that the native vlan.\n\nI would keep the business computers and printers on [192.168.2.1/24](https://192.168.2.1/24) and create another vlan (vlan02) for them.\n\nIs this the best way to configure opnsense? Should the switches, ap's and router be on the native vlan (vlan01)?\n\nThanks in advance for your comments.",
