I seemed to have develop some kind of sensitivity in that area despite all the nerves being removed. At one point I experienced pain eating on the right side of my mouth. X-rays revealed nothing. I had some issues with the gum between the second molar and the wisdom tooth but on my last examination everything was fine. Cold water or beverages cause pain on right side of my mouth. Just continuously have had pain in that area. Some days are worse than others. The wisdom tooth shows no signs of decay but I have been advised to have it extracted because the area is so hard to floss.\n\nNow I am having throbbing pain at the lower lateral incisor, canine and first premolar below the gum line. Pain in the upper jaw right side and the lower jaw where the pain was in first place. It will alternate. I know this is referred pain. \n\nWhat are causing these issues. For several years prior to the root canal I had pain and no one could figure out the problem. Only till the second molar became sensitive to dental instruments did it finally reveal itself. The root canal solved that and the pain I was getting in those prior years was much worse than what I have now. This feels like a toothache that never goes away. \n\nI was using a Phillips Sonicare which I stop using and went back to a regular brush. I also used a Waterpik in the past but that was making this pain much worse. I have switched to Sensodyne toothpaste to see if that would give me some relief. \n\nHow many years do I have to deal with this. My dentist always tells me how strong my teeth are. I am a 71 year old male and really wish someone could point me in the right direction to finding the cause of this pain.",

        "post": "In the Summer of 2019 I had root canal on my second molar lower jaw. I still have my last remaining wisdom tooth. It is fully exposed. I seemed to have develop some kind of sensitivity in that area despite all the nerves being removed. At one point I experienced pain eating on the right side of my mouth. X-rays revealed nothing. I had some issues with the gum between the second molar and the wisdom tooth but on my last examination everything was fine. Cold water or beverages cause pain on right side of my mouth. Just continuously have had pain in that area. Some days are worse than others. The wisdom tooth shows no signs of decay but I have been advised to have it extracted because the area is so hard to floss.\n\nNow I am having throbbing pain at the lower lateral incisor, canine and first premolar below the gum line. Pain in the upper jaw right side and the lower jaw where the pain was in first place. It will alternate. I know this is referred pain. \n\nWhat are causing these issues. For several years prior to the root canal I had pain and no one could figure out the problem. Only till the second molar became sensitive to dental instruments did it finally reveal itself. The root canal solved that and the pain I was getting in those prior years was much worse than what I have now. This feels like a toothache that never goes away. \n\nI was using a Phillips Sonicare which I stop using and went back to a regular brush. I also used a Waterpik in the past but that was making this pain much worse. I have switched to Sensodyne toothpaste to see if that would give me some relief. \n\nHow many years do I have to deal with this. My dentist always tells me how strong my teeth are. I am a 71 year old male and really wish someone could point me in the right direction to finding the cause of this pain.",

Please be honest with me, thank you in advance",
        "parent_comment": "You're spot on. It really is a much more complex issue that needs more than simple yes or no. I've personally suffered from agoraphobia for the last 4 years now.\n\nIt's quite severe but I do have safe spaces that I can go out to within my apartment and to the street, although it gets difficult to stay at the street for a long period of time. I can visit others in my apartment building. It's just going out further than that is difficult for me.\n\nIncome is quite the issue for me, and unfortunately is the biggest issue that prevented me from even thinking about being in a relationship. Past the agoraphobia itself anyways. I'm in the process of trying to get disability at the moment, and my lawyers have informed me that it'll take at least a year and a half from now to get it done. I'm quite ashamed to say that I'm living based on the graces of my family that has been helping and understanding so far. And to be honest, even if disability is approved it's still something I struggle with. I feel really... undeserving and it haunts me to know that I'll be receiving money due to my own inability rather than abilities/work.\n\nI've been in therapy and have tried and am continuing to try different medications. I have yet to make any progress in improvements despite this. We recently learned that my body does not metabolize SSRI medication effectively through a blood test, pharmacogenetics. It was awful hearing that news, knowing that many people with depression and anxiety have been helped by those medications. And knowing that the large majority of antidepressants and anxiety management drugs are SSRI's.\n\nI've had a lot of insight and growth in understanding my emotions thanks to therapy and have tried and are trying exposure therapy but have yet any real progression in terms of how I feel and how far/long I can go outside for. I seem to have a quite severe agoraphobia... Typically I have to take at least 2mg of Xanax to get myself manageable to go outside. Then taking more once I arrive at my destination to get myself under control again. There was a time where I had taken twelve 0.5mg Xanax'ed (6mg total) within a two hour period and I was still heavily anxious and stiff. To the point where holding a pen and writing hurt my hand and wrist.\n\nGeez, I wrote a long-winded reply. I apologize. Thank you for your thoughts and insight. I truly appreciate it.",
        "comment": "Not a long-winded response at all :) It is an interesting subject, I haven't considered dating anyone in the past few years for other health reasons (which have ironically led to my agoraphobia) so I am also curious if people would date me in the future haha. There is a lot of nuance and it is more complex than people initially realise to navigate the dating world whilst also dealing with health conditions, whether physical or mental. But those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind. \n\nYou have possibly had more progress than you realise but it is always difficult to see when it is small, slowly but surely. The fact that you recognise you have agoraphobia, have safe spaces, know your limits, go to therapy and are making an effort is all a lot of progress that you should be very proud of! \n\nIt is a shame that you are unable to take SSRI medications. It does sound like you have a deep insight into yourself and therapy is proving a positive influence in your life.\n\nDisability income is not undeserved if it is needed to survive and support yourself in being independent. I am unable to walk very far, does this make me undeserving of support? No. I use a walking stick to support me. It is the same principle for disability income, whether it is needed for physical or mental health conditions.",

While no serious damage besides a corneal cut and lots of pain, they gave me an eye drop which they said is safe. It was an NSAID. However I am reading online that these drops are category C and that there are adverse impacts in animal studies. I was reassured by the doctor in the ER they won't cause harm but I'm panicking not to mention not taking my next dose and deciding to just bear the eye pain. Has anyone had to take category C medicines or eye drops for pain? My maternity clinic is closed this week.  Thank you and sorry for the rant.",

The unfortunate part of life is that we tend to find partners who are like of our parent, all because they and their personality are \"familiar\".\n\n\nIn the most simple answer: *someone who isn't like your parent*.\n\n\nMy father-in-law was not a great father/husband, even my own father was not a great husband (lots of resentment spanning decades), but I digress.\n\n\nI propose a single exercise for this weekend:\nAsk yourself, if a friend/acquaintance/stranger, did or said [this] to me, would I be ok with it and want to be their friend?\n\n\nWe shouldn't accept any behavior from our partner that we wouldn't except from a friend. \n\n\nOne of the purposes of dating is to decide / discover what we like and what we're willing to accept.\n\n\nTake the next few days, look back at your previous relationships, and decide what you didn't like and why they didn't work.",
