        "post": "In the Summer of 2019 I had root canal on my second molar lower jaw. I still have my last remaining wisdom tooth. It is fully exposed. I seemed to have develop some kind of sensitivity in that area despite all the nerves being removed. At one point I experienced pain eating on the right side of my mouth. X-rays revealed nothing. I had some issues with the gum between the second molar and the wisdom tooth but on my last examination everything was fine. Cold water or beverages cause pain on right side of my mouth. Just continuously have had pain in that area. Some days are worse than others. The wisdom tooth shows no signs of decay but I have been advised to have it extracted because the area is so hard to floss.\n\nNow I am having throbbing pain at the lower lateral incisor, canine and first premolar below the gum line. Pain in the upper jaw right side and the lower jaw where the pain was in first place. It will alternate. I know this is referred pain. \n\nWhat are causing these issues. For several years prior to the root canal I had pain and no one could figure out the problem. Only till the second molar became sensitive to dental instruments did it finally reveal itself. The root canal solved that and the pain I was getting in those prior years was much worse than what I have now. This feels like a toothache that never goes away. \n\nI was using a Phillips Sonicare which I stop using and went back to a regular brush. I also used a Waterpik in the past but that was making this pain much worse. I have switched to Sensodyne toothpaste to see if that would give me some relief. \n\nHow many years do I have to deal with this. My dentist always tells me how strong my teeth are. I am a 71 year old male and really wish someone could point me in the right direction to finding the cause of this pain.",

And to be honest, even if disability is approved it's still something I struggle with. I feel really... undeserving and it haunts me to know that I'll be receiving money due to my own inability rather than abilities/work.\n\nI've been in therapy and have tried and am continuing to try different medications. I have yet to make any progress in improvements despite this. We recently learned that my body does not metabolize SSRI medication effectively through a blood test, pharmacogenetics. It was awful hearing that news, knowing that many people with depression and anxiety have been helped by those medications. And knowing that the large majority of antidepressants and anxiety management drugs are SSRI's.\n\nI've had a lot of insight and growth in understanding my emotions thanks to therapy and have tried and are trying exposure therapy but have yet any real progression in terms of how I feel and how far/long I can go outside for. I seem to have a quite severe agoraphobia... Typically I have to take at least 2mg of Xanax to get myself manageable to go outside.

        "comment": "Not a long-winded response at all :) It is an interesting subject, I haven't considered dating anyone in the past few years for other health reasons (which have ironically led to my agoraphobia) so I am also curious if people would date me in the future haha. There is a lot of nuance and it is more complex than people initially realise to navigate the dating world whilst also dealing with health conditions, whether physical or mental. But those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind. \n\nYou have possibly had more progress than you realise but it is always difficult to see when it is small, slowly but surely. The fact that you recognise you have agoraphobia, have safe spaces, know your limits, go to therapy and are making an effort is all a lot of progress that you should be very proud of! \n\nIt is a shame that you are unable to take SSRI medications. It does sound like you have a deep insight into yourself and therapy is proving a positive influence in your life.\n\nDisability income is not undeserved if it is needed to survive and support yourself in being independent. I am unable to walk very far, does this make me undeserving of support? No. I use a walking stick to support me. It is the same principle for disability income, whether it is needed for physical or mental health conditions.",

I can just do these habits and things will gradually get better, and I'll find antidepressants that work better and better and things will be okay\" and then sometimes \"Life is meaningless. There is no hope. None at all.\" \n\nThe thing that's helped me is to realize that neither of those thoughts can really be trusted. I shouldn't necessarily trust my overly optimistic self, but I shouldn't trust my completely depressed self either. The reality is that neither knows the future, and that although many people go through 20 antidepressants with no luck, there is always the chance that something could shift for me, either by antidepressants or some other means, that makes things livable. Do your own research and find a mental health professional who will actually take time to understand your situation and won't only prescribe SSRIs and SNRIs. This is key. \n\nAnd try to find and list things that can help in any way while you try to . Journal every day and get out of your head. Things like going for a walk, reading, etc. aren't cures for depression and are hard to do when you're depressed, but maybe there is that 20% of the time they can help. And so you can like clockwork try these things that might help. Some days none of them do. So then you just live for another day when they might.",
