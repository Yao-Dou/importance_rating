        "post": "In the Summer of 2019 I had root canal on my second molar lower jaw. I still have my last remaining wisdom tooth. It is fully exposed. I seemed to have develop some kind of sensitivity in that area despite all the nerves being removed. At one point I experienced pain eating on the right side of my mouth. X-rays revealed nothing. I had some issues with the gum between the second molar and the wisdom tooth but on my last examination everything was fine. Cold water or beverages cause pain on right side of my mouth. Just continuously have had pain in that area. Some days are worse than others. The wisdom tooth shows no signs of decay but I have been advised to have it extracted because the area is so hard to floss.\n\nNow I am having throbbing pain at the lower lateral incisor, canine and first premolar below the gum line. Pain in the upper jaw right side and the lower jaw where the pain was in first place. It will alternate. I know this is referred pain. \n\nWhat are causing these issues. For several years prior to the root canal I had pain and no one could figure out the problem. Only till the second molar became sensitive to dental instruments did it finally reveal itself.

The unfortunate part of life is that we tend to find partners who are like of our parent, all because they and their personality are \"familiar\".\n\n\nIn the most simple answer: *someone who isn't like your parent*.\n\n\nMy father-in-law was not a great father/husband, even my own father was not a great husband (lots of resentment spanning decades), but I digress.\n\n\nI propose a single exercise for this weekend:\nAsk yourself, if a friend/acquaintance/stranger, did or said [this] to me, would I be ok with it and want to be their friend?\n\n\nWe shouldn't accept any behavior from our partner that we wouldn't except from a friend. \n\n\nOne of the purposes of dating is to decide / discover what we like and what we're willing to accept.\n\n\nTake the next few days, look back at your previous relationships, and decide what you didn't like and why they didn't work.",

        "post": "Hello, r/relationship_advice! \n\nMy boyfriend [M26] and I [F24] have been dating for close to a year. We met on Hinge the day I was going to delete the app (cliche, I know) and he was the only person I ever actually met in person from using that dating app. We had wonderful chemistry and just really get along well, so we made things official and have been going strong ever since. \n\nI\u2019m not concerned about him cheating on me and I trust him completely, and I know he does the same for me, but I\u2019m afraid that my jealousy that\u2019s fueled by my insecurity is ruining our relationship, and I am wondering if you all think the same. If you do, what can I do to possibly prevent this from becoming a huge issue? \n\nI have OCD, and one of my obsessions is comparing myself to all the people around me. I don\u2019t treat myself well, and it\u2019s very frustrating for my boyfriend. When I\u2019m in the store, I spend all my time wondering about the lives of everyone I pass, if they are in a relationship, if they have a family, how they are treated, how are they better than me, how they could be a better fit for my partner, etc. This happens everywhere I go, with everyone. While this has caused a few hiccups in our relationship, most often it doesn\u2019t cause problems. Or it didn\u2019t. \n\nNow that we\u2019ve been together for a while, I\u2019ve gotten to meet and spend a lot of time with his friends and family. And I find myself obsessing over everything with them, which makes me not want to spend time with them, and prevents me from making those meaningful connections. We\u2019ve had many arguments about how jealous I get over his sister, his brothers  and their wives, etc. In the new year, he\u2019s decided that he and his roommates are going to try to get healthy and improve their lives, so now I have to compare myself to them, and this constant comparison to my boyfriend has already caused more fights than we\u2019ve ever had. I can\u2019t help but feel like this is going to run our relationship into the ground. What do you think? Can it be salvaged at this point? \n\nThank you!",

I always felt weird about worshipping Gods my blood isn't tied to? \n\nI also felt like the Gods may be linked to the land their people came from and couldn't totally reach me (as a woman in canada). I connected more with animism and nature, so I figured I didn't have any deities for me.\n\nRecently on the solstice I meditated into the spirit realm and was met with a Goddess, Freyja (I can include the whole experience below if anyone wants). I felt warm and connected after and slept. And woke up feeling conflicted and confused? \n\nI've never felt a call to the norse gods and honestly with Marvel it feels weird to think of most of their pantheon. Also it doesn't make sense a goddess would come to me, I'm no one.. I started my meditation asking for guidance. I went and checked my ancestry dna report again (my only blood relative is my mum and she's adopted so it's a mystery). I'm 15% norse based on three regions. I'm mostly Scottish so I figured I'd lean into celtic paganism but they feel so distant. \n\nI was a young witch a long time ago and experienced things that can't be explained without magick, I'm older now and finding my way again back to paganism but I'm frustrated trying to find my place and what I believe. I feel so sceptical now despite all I've seen with my own eyes, does anyone else have these issues? What did you do?",

I can just do these habits and things will gradually get better, and I'll find antidepressants that work better and better and things will be okay\" and then sometimes \"Life is meaningless. There is no hope. None at all.\" \n\nThe thing that's helped me is to realize that neither of those thoughts can really be trusted. I shouldn't necessarily trust my overly optimistic self, but I shouldn't trust my completely depressed self either. The reality is that neither knows the future, and that although many people go through 20 antidepressants with no luck, there is always the chance that something could shift for me, either by antidepressants or some other means, that makes things livable. Do your own research and find a mental health professional who will actually take time to understand your situation and won't only prescribe SSRIs and SNRIs. This is key. \n\nAnd try to find and list things that can help in any way while you try to . Journal every day and get out of your head. Things like going for a walk, reading, etc. aren't cures for depression and are hard to do when you're depressed, but maybe there is that 20% of the time they can help. And so you can like clockwork try these things that might help. Some days none of them do. So then you just live for another day when they might.",
