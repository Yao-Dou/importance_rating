Then flat lied to DoL saying  that I was a  contractor even though I signed a w2 and they withheld  taxes from my  paychecks. Luckily I still have a copy of every email and  form ever sent/signed.\n\nFair warning to anyone who intends to work at [SoftSages Technology](https://www.linkedin.com/company/softsages-technology/)  \n\n\nPosition lasted all of a week after I moved across state to get to it.",

Overall things went good for me, as I received three of them in the estimated time ( between Registered Air and EUB ) , and there's one that, although I still have not received, it's ok, because that one is SAL so it was expected. The problem is the fifth one, that was shipped with Registered Air Mail. It's now on the day sixty five of shipping, stuck in \"Plane has landed\" since day eight of November ( and that update just showed up in the day 28 of November ). \n\nWell, that's it. I know that's not Superbuy fault, as the one's handling the parcel now are couriers and etc, but I just wanted do blow some steam by writing it down.

One of the firms I contacted mostly just wanted to know if I was proficient in revit then I asked if he'd like a portfolio and he just said \"no, you're too early in your degree for a portfolio to tell me much\" (or something like that). This was while I was in third year. \n\nObviously it's different for everyone and portfolios are important, but reaching out to people and having a face to face conversation goes a loooong way, especially since a lot of younger people today are so anxious about making phone calls and meeting people in person (which is a HUGE part of architecture in practice.) Showing someone you're a smart, likable, pleasant person can go farther than a portfolio. \n\nYou could even just call up a firm and ask if they can show you around their office and talk about projects they're working on if it's hard to land an actual interview.",
