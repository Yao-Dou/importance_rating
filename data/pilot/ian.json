Ever since I\u2019ve been ok, but I\u2019m never that happy. It just feels like I\u2019m floating through life, like if the day was ok then I\u2019m ok, there\u2019s not much depth to it. I know we are pretty emotionless so maybe it\u2019s normal idk. But I also realized I\u2019m not as emotionally tied to anything like most people.. jobs, partners, homes.

That said; they have been working there for 6+ years while it\u2019s been 9 months for me. I have dreams like my own business and modeling, moving to the city, etc that I can\u2019t carry out yet bc I\u2019m still in college. But they give me enough to want to keep going and life feels ok for the most part. But nights like this I lay awake and just realize I feel kind of empty. It doesn\u2019t really bother me but sometimes I think it\u2019s too much emptiness if that makes sense. I look at other people and their enthusiasm for life seems a whole other level compared to mine. Whereas I kind of live day to day, and feel meh about everything.",

        "post": "I was clinically depressed during the COVID lockdown so I know what full-on depression is like for me.. not eating, constantly sleeping/laying around, always distracting myself through social media or music, etc. But I\u2019ve recovered since then and have been off my meds for over a year now. Ever since I\u2019ve been ok, but I\u2019m never that happy. It just feels like I\u2019m floating through life, like if the day was ok then I\u2019m ok, there\u2019s not much depth to it. I know we are pretty emotionless so maybe it\u2019s normal idk. But I also realized I\u2019m not as emotionally tied to anything like most people.. jobs, partners, homes. It just all feels temporary and i have a \u201cit will do for now\u201d or \u201cit is what it is\u201d mentality (But I think this view is valid because life is just constant change and impermanence). For example, my coworkers always complain about our job but for me it\u2019s okay, I know I just need money and don\u2019t plan on staying for long. That said; they have been working there for 6+ years while it\u2019s been 9 months for me. I have dreams like my own business and modeling, moving to the city, etc that I can\u2019t carry out yet bc I\u2019m still in college. But they give me enough to want to keep going and life feels ok for the most part. But nights like this I lay awake and just realize I feel kind of empty. It doesn\u2019t really bother me but sometimes I think it\u2019s too much emptiness if that makes sense. I look at other people and their enthusiasm for life seems a whole other level compared to mine. Whereas I kind of live day to day, and feel meh about everything.",

        "comment": "That's awesome. I love costumes, so I hope I have an experience like that someday. I just went out locally on my own, so maybe doing it with friends (if I had any) would feel better. I've cosplayed a female character at a comic con before - I don't really consider it as my first time presenting, since you get lots of crossdressers at these cons - but I didn't get a ton of compliments, though the few I did get did make me happy.\n\nI'm almost 23, so still quite young, but can't help but feel I missed out on so much youth, going to parties and wearing sexy dresses, not realising why I always isolated myself and hated hanging with other people until now. I'm still very much an introvert, but it's easier to imagine interacting with others as a woman than anything else.\n\nNext con, I'm going as a goth maid character with a longer dress, so maybe that'll be a cooler experience. Out of curiosity, what was your costume at this party?",

        "comment": "Sounds cool. Reminds me when I went on a pub crawl in my first year of uni, as I didn't become an egg until my third year. I took the 80s costume theme in a weird direction, and wore a skeleton morphsuit with neon legwarmers and tights (while everyone else was a ghostbuster or ninja turtle; I don't know what my brain was on). \n\nIt wasn't super feminine looking I don't think, but pretty flamboyant. However, I don't drink and my social skills are severely lacking, so it was a pretty lackluster night for me, but weirdly enough, I didn't feel as nervous going out like that than I expected. Guess I know why now.\n\nStill, a drag show would have been great. Must have felt awesome to embrace femininity and flamboyance like that.",
