So for me it wasn\u2019t that much more painful tbh. The big difference you have to consider is the after care and also getting used to a mouth piercing, which can take a lot of patience. Your lips move a lot and that can contribute to the initial swelling in the first few days. I found with my lip piercings as long as I didn\u2019t talk too much and ate and drank carefully it wasn\u2019t too bad. So keep this in mind, it\u2019s not just the initial pain you should be prepared for, it\u2019s the discomfort during healing you should consider too.",

I both draw and sculpt, and I feel like they are separate but complimentary entities. \n\nDrawing allows me to define the details, but sculpting lets me actualize it in real space. \n\nIn regards to sculpture, I feel like it\u2019s more important to start with physically working with the medium. You need to understand its parameters and limitations before you graduate to the finer details. \n\nLearning to draw is similar- you need to understand the basics of perspective, lighting, contrast. But that requires interpreting those elements into a two-dimensional form. \n\nPersonally, I struggle more with drawing, because that requires an additional level of mental calculation in order to achieve a complete actualization of my idea. \n\nWith sculpting, it\u2019s more organic - I can immediately tell if I\u2019m doing what needs to be done, because I can see it in real time, in 3D.",

I just went out locally on my own, so maybe doing it with friends (if I had any) would feel better. I've cosplayed a female character at a comic con before - I don't really consider it as my first time presenting, since you get lots of crossdressers at these cons - but I didn't get a ton of compliments, though the few I did get did make me happy.\n\nI'm almost 23, so still quite young, but can't help but feel I missed out on so much youth, going to parties and wearing sexy dresses, not realising why I always isolated myself and hated hanging with other people until now. I'm still very much an introvert, but it's easier to imagine interacting with others as a woman than anything else.\n\nNext con, I'm going as a goth maid character with a longer dress, so maybe that'll be a cooler experience. Out of curiosity, what was your costume at this party?",

I took the 80s costume theme in a weird direction, and wore a skeleton morphsuit with neon legwarmers and tights (while everyone else was a ghostbuster or ninja turtle; I don't know what my brain was on). \n\nIt wasn't super feminine looking I don't think, but pretty flamboyant. However, I don't drink and my social skills are severely lacking, so it was a pretty lackluster night for me, but weirdly enough, I didn't feel as nervous going out like that than I expected. Guess I know why now.\n\nStill, a drag show would have been great. Must have felt awesome to embrace femininity and flamboyance like that.",

Overall things went good for me, as I received three of them in the estimated time ( between Registered Air and EUB ) , and there's one that, although I still have not received, it's ok, because that one is SAL so it was expected. The problem is the fifth one, that was shipped with Registered Air Mail. It's now on the day sixty five of shipping, stuck in \"Plane has landed\" since day eight of November ( and that update just showed up in the day 28 of November ). \n\nWell, that's it. I know that's not Superbuy fault, as the one's handling the parcel now are couriers and etc, but I just wanted do blow some steam by writing it down.
