        "comment": "For me, it really depends. I both draw and sculpt, and I feel like they are separate but complimentary entities. \n\nDrawing allows me to define the details, but sculpting lets me actualize it in real space. \n\nIn regards to sculpture, I feel like it\u2019s more important to start with physically working with the medium. You need to understand its parameters and limitations before you graduate to the finer details. \n\nLearning to draw is similar- you need to understand the basics of perspective, lighting, contrast. But that requires interpreting those elements into a two-dimensional form. \n\nPersonally, I struggle more with drawing, because that requires an additional level of mental calculation in order to achieve a complete actualization of my idea. \n\nWith sculpting, it\u2019s more organic - I can immediately tell if I\u2019m doing what needs to be done, because I can see it in real time, in 3D.",

I just went out locally on my own, so maybe doing it with friends (if I had any) would feel better. I've cosplayed a female character at a comic con before - I don't really consider it as my first time presenting, since you get lots of crossdressers at these cons - but I didn't get a ton of compliments, though the few I did get did make me happy.\n\nI'm almost 23, so still quite young, but can't help but feel I missed out on so much youth, going to parties and wearing sexy dresses, not realising why I always isolated myself and hated hanging with other people until now. I'm still very much an introvert, but it's easier to imagine interacting with others as a woman than anything else.\n\nNext con, I'm going as a goth maid character with a longer dress, so maybe that'll be a cooler experience. Out of curiosity, what was your costume at this party?",

        "comment": "Sounds cool. Reminds me when I went on a pub crawl in my first year of uni, as I didn't become an egg until my third year. I took the 80s costume theme in a weird direction, and wore a skeleton morphsuit with neon legwarmers and tights (while everyone else was a ghostbuster or ninja turtle; I don't know what my brain was on). \n\nIt wasn't super feminine looking I don't think, but pretty flamboyant. However, I don't drink and my social skills are severely lacking, so it was a pretty lackluster night for me, but weirdly enough, I didn't feel as nervous going out like that than I expected. Guess I know why now.\n\nStill, a drag show would have been great. Must have felt awesome to embrace femininity and flamboyance like that.",

        "comment": "I just visited local firms and none of them even asked for one. They basically just had casual interviews. One of them offered me an internship right after and I took it. One of the firms I contacted mostly just wanted to know if I was proficient in revit then I asked if he'd like a portfolio and he just said \"no, you're too early in your degree for a portfolio to tell me much\" (or something like that). This was while I was in third year. \n\nObviously it's different for everyone and portfolios are important, but reaching out to people and having a face to face conversation goes a loooong way, especially since a lot of younger people today are so anxious about making phone calls and meeting people in person (which is a HUGE part of architecture in practice.) Showing someone you're a smart, likable, pleasant person can go farther than a portfolio. \n\nYou could even just call up a firm and ask if they can show you around their office and talk about projects they're working on if it's hard to land an actual interview.",
