So for me it wasn\u2019t that much more painful tbh. The big difference you have to consider is the after care and also getting used to a mouth piercing, which can take a lot of patience. Your lips move a lot and that can contribute to the initial swelling in the first few days. I found with my lip piercings as long as I didn\u2019t talk too much and ate and drank carefully it wasn\u2019t too bad. So keep this in mind, it\u2019s not just the initial pain you should be prepared for, it\u2019s the discomfort during healing you should consider too.",

I both draw and sculpt, and I feel like they are separate but complimentary entities. \n\nDrawing allows me to define the details, but sculpting lets me actualize it in real space. \n\nIn regards to sculpture, I feel like it\u2019s more important to start with physically working with the medium. You need to understand its parameters and limitations before you graduate to the finer details. \n\nLearning to draw is similar- you need to understand the basics of perspective, lighting, contrast. But that requires interpreting those elements into a two-dimensional form. \n\nPersonally, I struggle more with drawing, because that requires an additional level of mental calculation in order to achieve a complete actualization of my idea. \n\nWith sculpting, it\u2019s more organic - I can immediately tell if I\u2019m doing what needs to be done, because I can see it in real time, in 3D.",

The problem is the fifth one, that was shipped with Registered Air Mail. It's now on the day sixty five of shipping, stuck in \"Plane has landed\" since day eight of November ( and that update just showed up in the day 28 of November ). \n\nWell, that's it.

        "comment": "I just visited local firms and none of them even asked for one. They basically just had casual interviews. One of them offered me an internship right after and I took it. One of the firms I contacted mostly just wanted to know if I was proficient in revit then I asked if he'd like a portfolio and he just said \"no, you're too early in your degree for a portfolio to tell me much\" (or something like that). This was while I was in third year. \n\nObviously it's different for everyone and portfolios are important, but reaching out to people and having a face to face conversation goes a loooong way, especially since a lot of younger people today are so anxious about making phone calls and meeting people in person (which is a HUGE part of architecture in practice.) Showing someone you're a smart, likable, pleasant person can go farther than a portfolio. \n\nYou could even just call up a firm and ask if they can show you around their office and talk about projects they're working on if it's hard to land an actual interview.",
