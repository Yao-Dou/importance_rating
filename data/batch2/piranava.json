        "post": "My wife and I have been married for 3 years and together for 5. We have 3 kids together, ages 3, 1.5, and 6 months. When it was just us, things were great. She was loving and supportive and took care of everything at home while I worked. We both always wanted a family and started having kids. The first one was rough because of post partum depression. She stayed angry and sometimes got violent, but I wrote it off. The second pregnancy and third pregnancy went well with no post-partum, but things started to slope downhill. Since having kids, she's been verbally, emotionally, and sometimes physically abusive to me and the kids. She yells at them and snatches them up for being hungry, or playing, or getting into things and making messes. We've been to counseling and therapy. She's been in and out of institutions and has been on every different medication most doctors are comfortable prescribing, but things aren't getting better. If we divorced, I'm afraid of the kids baring the full force without me being there to absorb the bulk of the abuse, and afraid of working and never seeing them, as she doesn't work and hasn't since being a teenager. I don't think I would've gotten married or had kids if I saw this coming.",

It is also a two-in-one. When in tablet mode with the screen folded over, if the screen goes to sleep I cannot wake it without folding it back into a normal laptop. No buttons do anything and tapping the screen does nothing. I would ideally like to be able to tap the screen to wake it. Does anybody know of a fix or workaround ?

        "post": "Hey guys, so a few months ago I bought my first diesel truck which is an 05 Duramax and a few days ago I experienced my first -5 degree day with it. Recently It has been in the 40s and my truck drove absolutely perfect and then the temperature dropped very quick. I don\u2019t think I put enough antigel in the tank of diesel because I wasn\u2019t expecting the low low temps. When I went to start the truck in the cold it started up pretty easily so I let it idle for a good 10-15 minutes but then it shut off on me. I figured the diesel probably gelled up. I didn\u2019t drive it but It\u2019s now a few days later and it\u2019s 40 degrees again. I took it for a drive but I realized it\u2019s taking a bit longer to start and I\u2019m having a hard time accelerating and merging onto the highway. It seems like it\u2019s chocking when it gets up to about 40-50 mph and 2500rpms. From the research that I\u2019ve done it seems like the fuel filters got messed up from the gelling of the diesel. Can you guys confirm? \n\nThe truck only has 60k miles on it and it does have a FASS Lift Pump system on it aswell. I believe the FASS filters are new so would I have to replace those too aswell as the fuel filter in the engine bay? \n\nThanks, I still have a lot to learn about this truck",

I\u2019ve chewed addys before which felt insanely good and done coke and hydros, but so far I can manage to stay sober for good amounts of time. I\u2019m scared if I try mdma and go to some kinda concert it will be too fun and overstimulating that I\u2019ll get addicted or life will always feel lame compared to that high. Any input ?",

        "comment": "I have tried probably every class of drug. Opiates, benzos, amphetamines, dissos, you get the point. \n\nMDMA hands down feels better than anything else I've ever tried. X1,000. \n\n\nHere's the thing... it's not addictive. Not in the usual sense, at least. The next few days feel absolute shit, you don't really feel a need or desire to do it again right away. Unless you have an extremely addictive personality or a very unhealthy mindset, you should have no problem waiting 2 or 3 months between doses.",

I know a good amount of people (including me), who were addicted to mdma for a certain time and abused it, like taking it weekly or more. It probably did cost us one or the other brain cell, as we were combining it with some other drugs too, like alcohol, weed and speed...\n\nBut all of us got away from it, some had to step away from it forever, some (like me) learned to control the use and be more cautious about safer use... I think i don't know one person that ruined their life with mdma. I know people who spiraled into poly drug abuse in general and some of those definitely ruined their lifes though.",
