        "parent_comment": "I will say though, by excluding instrumentals you are missing out on a lot of fantastic guitar work in Precure. Shiho Terada's soundtracks in particular, her ability to mix electric guitar, even going in the metal direction, with orchestral sounds is phenomenal. Songs like Delicious Force Fierce Battle (Delicious Party first soundtrack album), Battle within the Storm (Healin' Good first soundtrack album), The Precure dance on the wind (Healin' Good second soundtrack album), Rampage Yaraneeda (Tropical Rouge first soundtrack album), Calling upon Black Pepper, Tense offense and Defense, and Facing off against a strong enemy (all from Delicious Party second soundtrack album) all feature fantastic guitar work (and Tense offense and defense also has some voice work). And there's plenty of others.",

That said, I\u2019m guessing there will come a time she\u2019s old enough that I\u2019d feel better about leaving. (Maybe not, who knows?) Wish I had advice for you. But be prepared, if you stay, you likely wont be happy and will have to find a way to find solace in the fact you\u2019re doing it for your young children. There is joy in watching them grow.

As crappy as I have been feeling lately I feel lucky I stopped after one child (once I noticed my spouse stopped caring about me soon after the birth). Yet I\u2019m still here (6 years later) because I love my child and know it\u2019s best for me to be here. That said, I\u2019m guessing there will come a time she\u2019s old enough that I\u2019d feel better about leaving. (Maybe not, who knows?) Wish I had advice for you. But be prepared, if you stay, you likely wont be happy and will have to find a way to find solace in the fact you\u2019re doing it for your young children. There is joy in watching them grow. Had I left, I would have missed out on a lot no doubt. Granted I probably would have been a happier and healthier person overall, but I definitely would have missed out on memories with my child.",

I would be grateful if any nurses out there could give me a bit of insight onto what to expect from the patients and the type of work on a ED Ward. A RMN at the Nursing home I work as a HCA in has told me that it is very emotionally draining and difficult at times and that the patients tend to be manipulative as often they might have depression or a PD alongside their Eating disorder but I would love to hear more about what to expect generally?.\n\nMany thanks!",

        "comment": "So I\u2019m a nurse on a CAMHS ward that accepts some ED patients. The ward will be very structured with set meal and snack times, there will mostly likely be different tables like red amber green based on someone\u2019s progress (that\u2019s how it is in camhs for our kids who get sent to ED wards), eating disorders are competitive and it affects ward dynamics a lot, you will learn a lot! Lots of physical health aspects. I don\u2019t like the word manipulative really but I suppose that\u2019s a way of describing it, eating disorders are not like any other mental illness in my opinion, classically people with EDs will try and \u201cmanipulate\u201d situations particularly around meal times or exercise but there will be strict rules around these things that will be easy for you to learn\n\nMost of all, enjoy it!!",

For our next stay we\u2019ll be at the Tropicana, and then in July we\u2019re staying at the Courtyard Theme Park. I\u2019m excited for that stay! Every room sleeps 6 and it\u2019s \u201cacross the street\u201d. BUT in September my friend and I are having a girls trip, and we\u2019re staying at the JW Hotel. I\u2019ll feel pretty accomplished these visits. Good luck, and have fun. You can\u2019t go wrong with any of your options.",

Imma get back to heaven now, busy with some angels, bye.\"\n\nGod showing up in the sky making that statement or something similar would have been the ultimate proof of his existence, but he doesn't care or may be he's just not real.\n\nIf he were real I doubt we would be having an argument about this in this first place because there will be valid and irrefutable proof of his existence (I've heard about several fraudulent proofs though).\n\nIf he doesn't really care enough to prove himself, then I don't think he would care much about people worshiping him and preaching about his existence.\n\nA God who cares about people worshiping and preaching about him shouldn't have any issue proving himself to his creations.\n\nOr, better still, he could just make his servants perform real miracles instead of fake ones they perform which further proves religion is fraud.",
