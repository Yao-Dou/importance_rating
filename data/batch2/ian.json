I think if it\u2019s done tastefully it\u2019s almost like gay jokes, if a gay joke is done tastefully and there\u2019s no malice behind it there\u2019s no problem in my mind. But in rap lyrics it\u2019s usually targeted at someone and not the entire gay community, maybe that person was a faggot. I kinda feel like there\u2019s a difference between being gay and being a faggot.",

        "comment": "So I\u2019m a nurse on a CAMHS ward that accepts some ED patients. The ward will be very structured with set meal and snack times, there will mostly likely be different tables like red amber green based on someone\u2019s progress (that\u2019s how it is in camhs for our kids who get sent to ED wards), eating disorders are competitive and it affects ward dynamics a lot, you will learn a lot! Lots of physical health aspects. I don\u2019t like the word manipulative really but I suppose that\u2019s a way of describing it, eating disorders are not like any other mental illness in my opinion, classically people with EDs will try and \u201cmanipulate\u201d situations particularly around meal times or exercise but there will be strict rules around these things that will be easy for you to learn\n\nMost of all, enjoy it!!",
