That also made her overthink and told me she's sure that there's a lot of people who changed the quran and put false hadith to scare people, so even a muslim is doubting her own religion? She said allah wouldn't create gays or people in general just to watch them suffer, i convinced her that homosexuality is natural cause they still exist till this day, if luts story is real then we wouldn't even exist,we also had a debate about polygamy, at first she said maybe they did that to bring more muslims to earth then she said saudis or whatever probably changed the quran to control women and allow men to have multiple women and now she's against it, we also had a debate about hoor al ayn and told her about the ahadith, she kept begging me to not believe these people cause there lying and that there's no sex in heaven, i told her you're describing christian heaven rn, islamic heaven has paradise, hoor and wine for men, she said god wouldn't forbid these these stuff here just to allow them in heaven, she kept saying that their islam is false and that the real one is the moderate one, she kept holding onto the \"lekol dini we lekom dinokom\" hadith even tho i told her there's so many hadith of mohammed saying to kill non believers, she also doubts that a good atheist would go to hell just because he's not a muslim, she kept trying hard to convince me that they're lying and that tunisians (my country) are the ones who follow the REAL islam but i just can't believe it when there's so many proof that islam allowed so many bad stuff.",

As a result, I have drifted more towards having girls as friends and hanging out with them.\n\nI mainly stuck around with this one friend group and I have heavy social anxiety. I have a few people outside of this man friend group but most of those are also friends in the outer circle of sorts in our friend group. \n\nRecently though drama happened, I have been completely kicked out of the group. They then went are their Instagram stories and posted very publicly about how they were so happy I was finally gone. Before this had happened, one of them who had been my best friend had cut me off after lying to me for weeks about still wanting to be my friend. This put our friendship in a really awkward place, past that, their one was a member that seemed to want to fix things, but had eventually turned on me. \n\nMy grades are dropping (I'm usually an A to A- student, no circling around A to C's), I don't have people to talk too, and I'm worried that again and again my anxieties are being proven correct again and again with my friend groups. My parents are amazing and have been very supportive of me though this time including getting me on anti-anxiety medication as well as getting me into therapy hopefully consistently in 2023. \n\nDoes anyone have some advice on what to do next? I'm lost because I don't feel as though I have direction anymore besides just high school (and some hobbies, DnD, 3D printing, video games etc). I will admit that the whole friend group was causing me to feel as though I was walking on eggshells constantly, so in some essence, I'm glad that its over.   \n\n\nSorry for this being so long so   \nTLDR: I have lost a lot of my friends from drama in high school, what should I do now?",

        "post": "Hey guys, so a few months ago I bought my first diesel truck which is an 05 Duramax and a few days ago I experienced my first -5 degree day with it. Recently It has been in the 40s and my truck drove absolutely perfect and then the temperature dropped very quick. I don\u2019t think I put enough antigel in the tank of diesel because I wasn\u2019t expecting the low low temps. When I went to start the truck in the cold it started up pretty easily so I let it idle for a good 10-15 minutes but then it shut off on me. I figured the diesel probably gelled up. I didn\u2019t drive it but It\u2019s now a few days later and it\u2019s 40 degrees again. I took it for a drive but I realized it\u2019s taking a bit longer to start and I\u2019m having a hard time accelerating and merging onto the highway. It seems like it\u2019s chocking when it gets up to about 40-50 mph and 2500rpms. From the research that I\u2019ve done it seems like the fuel filters got messed up from the gelling of the diesel. Can you guys confirm? \n\nThe truck only has 60k miles on it and it does have a FASS Lift Pump system on it aswell. I believe the FASS filters are new so would I have to replace those too aswell as the fuel filter in the engine bay? \n\nThanks, I still have a lot to learn about this truck",

I ask why God lets people teach false teachings in his name?  Why doesn't God step in and expose corrupt churches?  Why doesn't God stop people who do evil in his name?  \n\nMy questions put the ball in the believer's court.  Arguments about agency and free will.  God would not need to do any overt miracles.

I think i don't know one person that ruined their life with mdma. I know people who spiraled into poly drug abuse in general and some of those definitely ruined their lifes though.",
