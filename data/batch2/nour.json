        "post": "Hi I have mental disorder since end of last year/start of this year anyway for whatever reason, when I start taking birth control then stop and I took amitriptyline 10mg once and stop, then some other sleeping pills for less than a week and pregabalin 25mg once. I had a really bad reaction to the amitriptyline and the birth control pills and I have never been the same since. I keep thinking they triggered mental disorder or damaged/changed something in my brain to make me like this. I read all about things like the antibiotic floxing damage. And amitriptyline causing permanent eye damage and tinnitus. I feel like drugs are dangerous and I feel like they harmed me because I don't understand where this mental problems came from now. I took antibiotic Flucloxacillin months before all of this too but I don't remember it causing me anything bad. It was only the combined birth control pills I stop started and the amitriptyline and maybe sleeping pills other stuff that caused me bad lasting effects (or coincided with whatever is wrong with me). \n\nAre these meds I took not really dangerous and they really shouldn't do anything bad? It's like drinking alcohol or caffeine but not really? More like taking morphine? It shouldn't have lasting effects. But I can't understand what's wrong with my brain.

Most of the guys in my school are either homophobic, racist, sexist, or generally just dicks. As a result, I have drifted more towards having girls as friends and hanging out with them.\n\nI mainly stuck around with this one friend group and I have heavy social anxiety. I have a few people outside of this man friend group but most of those are also friends in the outer circle of sorts in our friend group. \n\nRecently though drama happened, I have been completely kicked out of the group. They then went are their Instagram stories and posted very publicly about how they were so happy I was finally gone. Before this had happened, one of them who had been my best friend had cut me off after lying to me for weeks about still wanting to be my friend. This put our friendship in a really awkward place, past that, their one was a member that seemed to want to fix things, but had eventually turned on me. \n\nMy grades are dropping (I'm usually an A to A- student, no circling around A to C's), I don't have people to talk too, and I'm worried that again and again my anxieties are being proven correct again and again with my friend groups. My parents are amazing and have been very supportive of me though this time including getting me on anti-anxiety medication as well as getting me into therapy hopefully consistently in 2023. \n\nDoes anyone have some advice on what to do next? I'm lost because I don't feel as though I have direction anymore besides just high school (and some hobbies, DnD, 3D printing, video games etc). I will admit that the whole friend group was causing me to feel as though I was walking on eggshells constantly, so in some essence, I'm glad that its over.   \n\n\nSorry for this being so long so   \nTLDR: I have lost a lot of my friends from drama in high school, what should I do now?",

It is also a two-in-one. When in tablet mode with the screen folded over, if the screen goes to sleep I cannot wake it without folding it back into a normal laptop. No buttons do anything and tapping the screen does nothing. I would ideally like to be able to tap the screen to wake it. Does anybody know of a fix or workaround ? Possibly some third party software ? Any help would be greatly appreciated it's just been one dead end after another.",

I would be grateful if any nurses out there could give me a bit of insight onto what to expect from the patients and the type of work on a ED Ward. A RMN at the Nursing home I work as a HCA in has told me that it is very emotionally draining and difficult at times and that the patients tend to be manipulative as often they might have depression or a PD alongside their Eating disorder but I would love to hear more about what to expect generally?.\n\nMany thanks!",

        "post": "Hi everyone!\n\nI am a first year Mental Health Nursing student and I have my first placement on a specialist Eating Disorder Unit which begins in a few weeks.\n\nAt first, I was so excited to start the placement as Eating Disorders have always been something which have been a specialist interest so I was happy when I found out I got a placement on a ED ward. \n\nHowever the last few days, I have been getting really nervous about starting because I don't really know what to expect if I'm honest. I would be grateful if any nurses out there could give me a bit of insight onto what to expect from the patients and the type of work on a ED Ward. A RMN at the Nursing home I work as a HCA in has told me that it is very emotionally draining and difficult at times and that the patients tend to be manipulative as often they might have depression or a PD alongside their Eating disorder but I would love to hear more about what to expect generally?.\n\nMany thanks!",

        "comment": "So I\u2019m a nurse on a CAMHS ward that accepts some ED patients. The ward will be very structured with set meal and snack times, there will mostly likely be different tables like red amber green based on someone\u2019s progress (that\u2019s how it is in camhs for our kids who get sent to ED wards), eating disorders are competitive and it affects ward dynamics a lot, you will learn a lot! Lots of physical health aspects. I don\u2019t like the word manipulative really but I suppose that\u2019s a way of describing it, eating disorders are not like any other mental illness in my opinion, classically people with EDs will try and \u201cmanipulate\u201d situations particularly around meal times or exercise but there will be strict rules around these things that will be easy for you to learn\n\nMost of all, enjoy it!!",

        "post": "Hey guys, so a few months ago I bought my first diesel truck which is an 05 Duramax and a few days ago I experienced my first -5 degree day with it. Recently It has been in the 40s and my truck drove absolutely perfect and then the temperature dropped very quick. I don\u2019t think I put enough antigel in the tank of diesel because I wasn\u2019t expecting the low low temps. When I went to start the truck in the cold it started up pretty easily so I let it idle for a good 10-15 minutes but then it shut off on me. I figured the diesel probably gelled up. I didn\u2019t drive it but It\u2019s now a few days later and it\u2019s 40 degrees again. I took it for a drive but I realized it\u2019s taking a bit longer to start and I\u2019m having a hard time accelerating and merging onto the highway. It seems like it\u2019s chocking when it gets up to about 40-50 mph and 2500rpms. From the research that I\u2019ve done it seems like the fuel filters got messed up from the gelling of the diesel. Can you guys confirm? \n\nThe truck only has 60k miles on it and it does have a FASS Lift Pump system on it aswell. I believe the FASS filters are new so would I have to replace those too aswell as the fuel filter in the engine bay? \n\nThanks, I still have a lot to learn about this truck",

I remember being into Greek mythology as a kid, going to school at a catholic grade school, and thinking how silly the Greeks were - because duh, there\u2019s only one God. Silly Greeks and Romans. When in reality it is all sci-fi. A successful cult is still a cult and it\u2019s all science fiction bullshit designed to manipulate.",
